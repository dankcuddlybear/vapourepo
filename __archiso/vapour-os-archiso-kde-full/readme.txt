Vapour OS x86_64 KDE
KDE Plasma is a beatiful, advanced desktop environment with a familiar feel.
It runs well on most PCs made after 2005 and doesn't consume too much resources
given it's extensive functionality. KDE Plasma is well optimised for touchscreen
devices.
This edition of Vapour OS features a customised KDE Plasma desktop session,
with pretty colours, wallpapers and icons. Vapour OS KDE is the most maintained
version of Vapour OS, with the most features and updates.

[CONSISTENT APPLICATION APPEARANCE]
Most graphical apps on Linux use either the GTK or QT toolkit to display menus
and buttons. GTK is simpler in design, while QT has more advanced features
like colour schemes and proper support for high pixel density screens.
Currently, most graphical apps use GTK3, GTK4, QT5 or QT6.
KDE Plasma and KDE applications are based on QT5, so QT5 applications are better
overall. GTK3 applications also work, but QT5 is preferred.
GTK1-2 and QT1-4 are outdated and should be avoided.
GTK4 theme support is borked, and GTK4 applications may look different.
QT6 theme switching is buggy. Theme switching may be ineffective, or cause
issues like black text on a black background, until you re-launch the application.
