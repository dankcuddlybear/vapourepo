Vapour OS x86_64 XFCE
XFCE is a lightweight desktop environment, and will run on almost any device.
This edition of Vapour OS features a customised XFCE desktop session with a
familiar layout.

[DISCLAIMER]
XFCE has less features and is slightly less easy to use than KDE Plasma.
Touch screen support is also more limited than KDE Plasma.
Vapour OS XFCE isn't updated as regularly as Vapour OS KDE.
If your device meets the recommended specifications for KDE Plasma, it is
recommended to use Vapour OS KDE instead.

[CONSISTENT APPLICATION APPEARANCE]
Most graphical apps on Linux use either the GTK or QT toolkit to display menus
and buttons. GTK is simpler in design, while QT has more advanced features
like colour schemes and proper support for high pixel density screens.
Currently, most graphical apps use GTK3, GTK4, QT5 or QT6.
XFCE and XFCE applications are based on GTK3, so GTK3 applications are preferred.
QT5 applications also work well.
GTK1-2 and QT1-4 are outdated and should be avoided.
GTK4 theme support is borked, and GTK4 applications may look different.
QT6 theme switching is buggy. Theme switching may be ineffective, or cause
issues like black text on a black background, until you re-launch the application.
