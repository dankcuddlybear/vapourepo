HOW TO BUILD

First, add the following repositories as Vapour OS depends on them. You can add them after all other repositories if you want.
1) Add CachyOS repository to your system (github.com/CachyOS/linux-cachyos#how-to-add-cachyos-repositories). Only "cachyos" (x86_64) is required.
2) Add Chaotic-AUR repository to your system (aur.chaotic.cx).
3) Add Vapour OS repository to your system (github.com/dankcuddlybear/vapourepo).

Now build the iso.
4) chmod +x build.sh; ./build.sh
